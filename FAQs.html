  <h4><b>What is hairways?</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
    Hairways is here to bridge the gap between Salon owners and their (prospective)Castomers
    We do this by providing Salons a platform to be found by their castumers. Castomers can see and rank
    Salons and comment or write a short review of Salons they have visited.
     They can also book for Salon services from their Salon of via Hairways.</p>

  <h4><b>How do I get my Salon listed?</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
    Simple just <i><a>create an account<a></i> with us and confirm Your
    email address. Then from your dashboard feed in your Salon details and choose your
    favourite plan. Once your subscription is confirmed your salon will be up and running.
    </p>


  <h4><b>What is your pricing?</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
      We try to have friendly prices just to keep our servers running and give a token to give
      to our developers. You get a one month free after that you choose a plan starting from as
      low as <b>Ksh.950/Month</b> see our <b> <a href="pricing_page.html">pricing</a></b> for more informantion

  <h4><b>Why is my Salon not listed in the front page?</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
      To be listed in the front page, you will need to upgrade your current subscription
      or find higher ranking by your custmers. Remind them to rate you on
      </a href="hairways.co.ke">hairways.co.ke</a> after serving them.
    </p>


  <h4><b>How do you prevent unlegit ratings</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
      We have scrips dedicated for doing exarctly that. Also Viewers can only rate after
      visiting the . The salon owner must also confirm their visiting.<i> "Hakuna mbuzi
      kuruka kamba."</i>
    </p>

  <h4><b>How do I comment,like and or rank a salon?</b></h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Before you can like,comment and or rank a salon you have to book a service from
        that salon. However anyone can view all the above anytime.
